# Second Year Flutter Project

## **Basic Premise**
I am going to create a game of minesweeper using flutter and the flame game engine (libary)

## **Reasoning**
I am doing this to develop understanding of both game development and the interactions involved in a full stack project

## Design
There is a full class diagram that has been created in Lucid Chart for this project. This outlines the basic structure of both the backend and the frontend. It also models the interactions between the front and back ends.
